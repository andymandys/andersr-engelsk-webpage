                only found in Hawaii. The marine animal is the humpback whale. Every year, thousands of humpback whales migrate to Hwaii's

                <h2>Political system</h2>
            <p>Hawaii, as you probably know, is one of the 50 states of America. It became the 50th state on August 21, 1959. The state has a democratic political system 
                with three branches of government. The executive, legislative and judicial branch. The govener is the head of the executive branch.
                The legisLative branch consists of the Hawaii State senate and the Hawaii House of Representetives. And lastly the judicial branch
                is made up of the Hawaii State supreme court and Lower courts. The executive branch enforces the laws, the LegisLative branch
                makes the Laws and the judicial branch interprets the laws. The state government is modeled after the federal government of the 
                United States.

                    refuge for ancient Hawaiians who broke the law. However today it is a place where you can learn about Hawaiian culture and history.
